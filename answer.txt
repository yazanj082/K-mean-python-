problem a:
the percentage change in cost after 10 iterations :
	
	for c1 is:0.26483917144562047
	for c2 is:0.7669795594605943

c2 is beter than c1 because the distacne between the points and their initial
centers will be big at initialization the points will be in tense between the diffrent center points when 
the center point changes alot more points will change wich center they belong to so that will 
give higher porpablility of finding better center point so the improvment rate will be better

problem b:
the percentage change in cost after 10 iterations :
	
	for c1 is:-0.02966459207764418
	for c2 is:-0.0018895865097607058

c1 is better than c2 because in the cosine similarity the equation is devided over the distance of each point
multiplyed by the other so when the point is far the similarity will be higher so the points will get 
in stauration faster so it will not improve a lot in c1 because the similarity will be lower at first the points
will be in tense  between the diffrent center points when the center point changes 
alot more points will change wich center they belong to so that will give higher porpablility of finding 
better center point so the improvment rate will be better

Euclidean vs cosine:

as we saw in prblem a and problem b it depends on initial centers positions but over all the cosine similarity 
will get to sturation faster and Euclidean will give better percentage change in cost.
